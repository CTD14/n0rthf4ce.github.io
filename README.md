## DESCRIPTION OF LAYOUT

- I wrote this 4 page web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also wrote it in a bootstrap framework that’s great for material design and transition flow using animations.
- Most buttons are static excluding the navigation bar that takes you through each page.
- The first page or landing page is named template.html and from there you can move pages.
